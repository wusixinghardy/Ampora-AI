# Ampora AI

AI-powered career coaching and learning platform that tracks the progress of students and early-career professionals, personalizes learning content, and simulates role-specific mock interviews to build job-ready skills.

Our first step is to generate video courses on STEM topics. Students can input any technical concept (like "explain convolutional neural networks" or "how to prep for a Google SWE interview") and receive a complete video lesson with slides, voiceover, and visual explanations generated in minutes.

We're building this because quality STEM education materials are expensive and time-consuming to create, but AI can now generate personalized explanations at near-zero cost, making technical education accessible to everyone regardless of their financial background.
